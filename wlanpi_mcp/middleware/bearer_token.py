    Represent the connecting token as an ASGI principal.

    The principal is keyed by a fingerprint of the token itself. The MCP
    streamable HTTP session manager binds a session to the principal on
    scope["user"] when the session is created and rejects any later request
    on that session whose principal differs (mcp/server/streamable_http_manager.py).
    The daemon runs the transport stateless, so there are no sessions to bind
    and every request stands alone with its own token; the principal is still
    published so that property holds unchanged if stateful mode is ever turned
    on.

    We hash rather than parse the JWT: this middleware never validates tokens
    (that is wlanpi-core's job), and the fingerprint only needs to be stable
    and unique per token. The raw token stays out of the principal object; it
    already lives in the contextvar for the actual API call.

    Require a wlanpi-core JWT on every HTTP request and stash it in a contextvar.

    The JWT must arrive as 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' so CoreClient can
    pass it through to wlanpi-core. The token is not validated here —
    wlanpi-core rejects bad tokens with a 401, which propagates back to the MCP
    client as a tool error.

    Pure ASGI middleware (not BaseHTTPMiddleware) so the downstream app runs
    in the same task. The streamable HTTP transport starts the per-request
    MCP server task from inside this request, so the contextvar set here is
    inherited by that task. The primary token source is nonetheless the
    request itself: get_token() reads the Authorization header off the
    Starlette request that the transport binds to each MCP call.

    It also publishes a per-token principal on scope["user"] so a stateful
    session manager would bind each session to its opening token (see
    _principal_for).
