        Start the wlanpi-profiler to capture 802.11 client capability information.

        The profiler brings up a fake AP and captures association frames from clients
        to determine their 802.11 capabilities (PHY support, spatial streams, etc.).

        Args:
            interface: WLAN interface to use (e.g. 'wlan0')
            channel: 802.11 channel number to operate on (1-233)
            frequency: Frequency in MHz (alternative to channel)
            ssid: SSID for the fake AP (default chosen by profiler)
            no11r: Disable 802.11r (Fast BSS Transition) support
            no11ax: Disable 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) support
            no11be: Disable 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) support
            wpa3_personal: Enable WPA3-Personal only mode
            wpa3_personal_transition: Enable WPA3-Personal Transition mode
            noAP: Run without bringing up an AP (passive capture only)
            noprep: Skip interface preparation (use when the interface is
                already set up in monitor mode on the right channel)
            noprofilertlv: Don't add the profiler's vendor TLVs to beacons
            oui_update: Update the OUI (manufacturer) database from the
                Internet before starting; needs Internet access
            no_bpf_filters: Remove the sniffer's BPF filters (sees more
                frames, but may reduce profiler performance)
            debug: Enable debug logging in profiler

        Core waits (up to about 25 s) for the profiler to run or fail, then
        returns {"success": bool, "reason": str | null, "message": str | null}.

        success false means the profiler did NOT start - do not report it as
        started. Show the user 'message', which says why. 'reason' is one of:
            - the profiler's own exit reason when it exited during startup,
              e.g. 'country_code_detection' (no regulatory domain set) or
              'interface_validation' (unknown interface)
            - 'exited': it exited during startup without giving a reason
            - 'already_running': a profiler started by core is still running;
              stop it (stop_profiler) first if new settings are wanted
            - 'spawn_failed': the profiler could not be launched

        success true with reason 'starting' means it was still starting when
        the wait ended. In AP mode, poll get_profiler_status until 'running'
        is true before telling the user clients can connect.
