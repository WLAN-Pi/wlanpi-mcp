"""
Non-streaming, file-backed Wi-Fi capture tools.

Where the streaming tools capture_scan/capture_observe run a bounded window and
return a dissected summary, these run a capture in the *background* — holding
the wlanpi-core
capture WebSocket open past the tool call — and write the raw pcapng byte
stream to a file in a managed directory on the device. That lifts the 60 s
window cap (a returned summary must stay small; a file need not) so a capture
can run for minutes, and a later fetch hands the file back to the client as a
pcapng blob for analysis in Wireshark/tshark.

This deliberately relaxes two capture invariants (see CLAUDE.md): the result is
raw pcapng, not a dissected summary, and it writes and then reads a local file.
Both are scoped tightly — every file lives under PCAP_CAPTURE_DIR, and the
fetch tool refuses any path outside it — and the bytes still come only from the
core capture WebSocket: no local subprocess, no other transport, same JWT.

        Start a background, non-streaming packet capture to a pcapng file.

        This is the non-streaming counterpart to capture_scan: unlike that
        streaming tool, it does not block and does not return a dissected
        summary. It starts a capture, keeps the core WebSocket open in the
        background, and writes the raw pcapng bytes to a file under a managed
        directory on the device. Because nothing is held in memory or returned
        inline, the capture can run far longer than the 60 s capture_scan
        window — up to the server's configured maximum. The call returns
        immediately with the capture_id and file path; the capture then runs on
        its own until duration_s elapses or you call stop_pcap_file. Retrieve
        the file with fetch_pcap_file(capture_id=...) (a pcapng blob) once it
        has stopped.

                the adapter supports.
            width: Channel width in MHz: 20, 40, 80 or 160.
            dwell_ms: Milliseconds to dwell on each channel (50-60000).
            duration_s: How long the background capture runs, in seconds, from 1
                up to the server maximum (default max 3600). The call itself
                returns immediately.

        the capture named by capture_id (preferred) or by an explicit
        on-device path. Open it in Wireshark/tshark for analysis. Fetch after
